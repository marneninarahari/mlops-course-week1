# <h1 align="center" id="heading">Phase V - Data and Model Version Control using DVC and MLflow</h1>


## ‚òëÔ∏è Objectives
At the end of this session, you will have a brief understanding of how to:
- [ ] Track different different datasets
- [ ] Track and compare ML experiments
- [ ] Track and survey ML models

## üõ†Ô∏è Pre-Assignment

#### Option 1 : Create environment using `environment.yml`
1. Create a virtual environment with üêç conda using `environment.yml`: 

```console
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

2. Activate your conda virtual environment:

```console
conda activate dvc_mlflow_env
```
#### Option 2 : Create environment using `requirements.txt`

1. Create a virtual environment with üêç conda from scratch: 

```console
conda create -n dvc_mlflow_env python=3.8
```
 
2. Activate your conda virtual environment:

```console
conda activate dvc_mlflow_env
```

3. Install requirements using `pip` and `requirements.txt`

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Tasks
There are two tasks for this phase:
1. Open and complete `dvc_mlflow.ipynb`
2. Submit a link to your Hugging Face profile
3. Submit screenshots of your MLflow experiments with the name `lastname_firstname_screenshot-number`
